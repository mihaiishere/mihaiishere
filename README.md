# A few words about me :dancer:

Hello, I'm Mihai. In the last years I found my place in this society and that's behind numbers. Currently I am working as a Data Analyst with expertise in finance and reporting having the below main activities.

- Generate reports and analyze/reconcile the data
- Create queries based on SQL
- Automatize or optimize processes using VBA/Python

### :floppy_disk: See my projects on my [portfolio](https://github.com/mihaiishere/Portfolio/blob/main/README.md). 
### :incoming_envelope: Connect with me on [Linkedin](linkedin.com/in/mihai-andrei-g-b78120b7)

:bulb: As a side note, whenever I encounter a problem, I am the kind of person who seeks out the right tool and applies it to bring a solution to life.
